# Python Twitter analysis

# How was the analysis brought about:

1)Created a new twitter profile and logged into the twitter API as a developer.

2)Extracted the url and API Key simuntaneously.

3)Using Jupyter Notebook of Anaconda as my IDE for coding in Python, performed a set of relevant analysis using sentimental analysis and word cloud.
